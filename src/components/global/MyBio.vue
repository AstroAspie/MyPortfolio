    <!-- General -->
    <p>
      I am a mostly self-taught full-stack developer with over <u><b><i>five</i></b></u> years experience and a passion for all things technology, 
      programming and cybersecurity. I have quite a broad range of experience ranging from web based projects with ReactJS, Vue and Angular
      with varying backend technologies including FastAPI, Express, Asp.Net, Django, and more. My cybersecurity experience is more niche based in 
      offensive security although I am well versed in architecturual security and defensive techniques.

    <br />
    <!-- Current Work -->
    <p class="current-work">
      Currently, I work a 9-5 as a FullStack Developer at Enco Group ltd and freelance developer in my leisure/free time.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      I am always looking to learn new things and improve my skills. I like to think myself a quick
      learner and hard worker and am always looking for new and exciting opportunities to spread my 
      wings, learn something interesting and grow in the development world.
    </p>
    <!-- <p>
      In my spare time, I mostly enjoy spending time with my twin daughters and
      my wife. I also enjoy refining my development skills, bug bounty hunting, watching movies, 
      and reading various genres of books.
