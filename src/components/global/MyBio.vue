    <p>
      I am a full-stack developer with a passion for web technologies and
      cybersecurity. I have experience in developing web applications using
      JavaScript, Node.js, and Vue.js. I am also interested in cybersecurity
      and have experience in penetration testing and digital forensics.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently working as both a freelance developer and a "day-job" as a
      Full-Stack Developer at ENCO Group ltd.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a self-taught developer and have been coding for over 5 years. I am
      always looking to learn new things and improve my skills. I am a quick
      learner and a hard worker. I am always looking for new and exciting
      opportunities to spread my wings and learn new things in the development world.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my spare time, I mostly enjoy spending time with my twin daughters and
      my wife. I also enjoy refining my development skills, bug bounty hunting, watching movies, 
      and reading various genres of books.
