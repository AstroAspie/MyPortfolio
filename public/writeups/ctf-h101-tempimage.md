For this first flag I did quite a bit of investigating with the trusty burp suite.
I tried the typical vectors of uploading phtml but nothing but errors asking for a png..

I found that when uploading an image however, there is a second Content-Disposition header... This could be interesting, so I tried to upload some php to the vector but still nothing.

At this point I went back to the redirect and saw /files/&lt;somehash-image-uploaded&gt; and the same within the header. So instead of uploading to the /files directory, what about getting to the /index with some directory traversal.
